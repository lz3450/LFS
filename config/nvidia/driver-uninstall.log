-> If you plan to no longer use the NVIDIA driver, you should make sure that no X screens are configured to use the NVIDIA X driver in your X configuration file. If you used nvidia-xconfig to configure X, it may have created a backup of your original configuration. Would you like to run `nvidia-xconfig --restore-original-backup` to attempt restoration of the original X configuration file? (Answer: No)

WARNING: Your driver installation has been altered since it was initially installed; this may happen, for example, if you have since installed the NVIDIA driver through a mechanism other than nvidia-installer (such as your distribution's native package management system).  nvidia-installer will attempt to uninstall as best it can.  Please see the file '/home/kzl/LFS/config/nvidia/nvidia-uninstall.log' for details.
