Configuration of readline 8.2:

Optional Features:
  --disable-option-checking  ignore unrecognized --enable/--with options
  --disable-FEATURE       do not include FEATURE (same as --enable-FEATURE=no)
  --enable-FEATURE[=ARG]  include FEATURE [ARG=yes]
  --enable-multibyte      enable multibyte characters if OS supports them
  --enable-shared         build shared libraries [[default=YES]]
  --enable-static         build static libraries [[default=YES]]
  --disable-install-examples
                          don't install examples [[default=install]]
  --disable-bracketed-paste-default
                          disable bracketed paste by default
                          [[default=enable]]
  --disable-largefile     omit support for large files

Optional Packages:
  --with-PACKAGE[=ARG]    use PACKAGE [ARG=yes]
  --without-PACKAGE       do not use PACKAGE (same as --with-PACKAGE=no)
  --with-curses           use the curses library instead of the termcap
                          library
  --with-shared-termcap-library
                          link the readline shared library against the
                          termcap/curses shared library [[default=NO]]

Some influential environment variables:
  CC          C compiler command
  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
  CPP         C preprocessor

Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.
