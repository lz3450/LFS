  --disable-silent-rules  verbose build output (undo: "make V=0")
  --enable-dependency-tracking
                          do not reject slow dependency extractors

                           Also, issue synclines from the examples/ to
                           the corresponding source in the Texinfo doc.
  --disable-yacc          do not build a yacc command or an -ly library
  --enable-cross-guesses={conservative|risky}
                          specify policy for cross-compilation guesses
  --disable-assert        turn off assertions
  --enable-relocatable    install a package that can be moved in the file
                          system
  --disable-nls           do not use Native Language Support

Optional Packages:
  --with-PACKAGE[=ARG]    use PACKAGE [ARG=yes]
  --without-PACKAGE       do not use PACKAGE (same as --with-PACKAGE=no)
  --with-gnu-ld           assume the C compiler uses GNU ld [default=no]
  --with-libtextstyle-prefix[=DIR]  search for libtextstyle in DIR/include and DIR/lib
  --without-libtextstyle-prefix     don't search for libtextstyle in includedir and libdir
  --with-libiconv-prefix[=DIR]  search for libiconv in DIR/include and DIR/lib
  --without-libiconv-prefix     don't search for libiconv in includedir and libdir
  --with-libreadline-prefix[=DIR]  search for libreadline in DIR/include and DIR/lib
  --without-libreadline-prefix     don't search for libreadline in includedir and libdir
  --with-libintl-prefix[=DIR]  search for libintl in DIR/include and DIR/lib
  --without-libintl-prefix     don't search for libintl in includedir and libdir

Some influential environment variables:
  CC          C compiler command
  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
  CXX         C++ compiler command
  CXXFLAGS    C++ compiler flags
  CPP         C preprocessor
  YACC        The `Yet Another Compiler Compiler' implementation to use.
              Defaults to the first program found out of: `bison -y', `byacc',
              `yacc'.
  YFLAGS      The list of arguments that will be passed by default to $YACC.
              This script will default YFLAGS to the empty string to avoid a
              default value of `-d' given by some make applications.
  M4          Location of GNU M4 1.4.6 or later. Defaults to the first program
              of 'm4', 'gm4', or 'gnum4' on PATH that meets Autoconf needs.

Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.
