Configuration of git 2.49.0:

Optional Features:
  --disable-option-checking  ignore unrecognized --enable/--with options
  --disable-FEATURE       do not include FEATURE (same as --enable-FEATURE=no)
  --enable-FEATURE[=ARG]  include FEATURE [ARG=yes]
  --enable-pthreads=FLAGS FLAGS is the value to pass to the compiler to enable
                          POSIX Threads. The default if FLAGS is not specified
                          is to try first -pthread and then -lpthread.
                          --disable-pthreads will disable threading.
  --enable-jsmin=PATH     PATH is the name of a JavaScript minifier or the
                          absolute path to one.
  --enable-cssmin=PATH    PATH is the name of a CSS minifier or the absolute
                          path to one.

Optional Packages:
  --with-PACKAGE[=ARG]    use PACKAGE [ARG=yes]
  --without-PACKAGE       do not use PACKAGE (same as --with-PACKAGE=no)
  --with-sane-tool-path=DIR-1[:DIR-2...:DIR-n]
                          Directories to prepend to PATH in build system and
                          generated scripts
  --with-lib=ARG          ARG specifies alternative name for lib directory
  --with-openssl          use OpenSSL library (default is YES)
                          ARG can be prefix for openssl library and headers
  --with-libpcre1         DEPRECATED
  --with-libpcre          synonym for --with-libpcre2
  --with-libpcre2         support Perl-compatible regexes via libpcre2
                          (default is NO)
                          ARG can be also prefix for libpcre library and
                          headers
  --with-curl             support http(s):// transports (default is YES)
                          ARG can be also prefix for curl library and headers
  --with-expat            support git-push using http:// and https://
                          transports via WebDAV (default is YES)
                          ARG can be also prefix for expat library and headers
  --without-iconv         if your architecture doesn't properly support iconv
  --with-iconv=PATH       PATH is prefix for libiconv library and headers
                          used only if you need linking with libiconv
  --with-gitconfig=VALUE  Use VALUE instead of /etc/gitconfig as the global
                          git configuration file. If VALUE is not fully
                          qualified it will be interpreted as a path relative
                          to the computed prefix at runtime.
  --with-gitattributes=VALUE
                          Use VALUE instead of /etc/gitattributes as the
                          global git attributes file. If VALUE is not fully
                          qualified it will be interpreted as a path relative
                          to the computed prefix at runtime.
  --with-pager=VALUE      Use VALUE as the fall-back pager instead of 'less'.
                          This is used by things like 'git log' when the user
                          does not specify a pager to use through alternate
                          methods. eg: /usr/bin/pager
  --with-editor=VALUE     Use VALUE as the fall-back editor instead of 'vi'.
                          This is used by things like 'git commit' when the
                          user does not specify a preferred editor through
                          other methods. eg: /usr/bin/editor
  --with-shell=PATH       provide PATH to shell
  --with-perl=PATH        provide PATH to perl
  --with-python=PATH      provide PATH to python
  --with-zlib=PATH        provide PATH to zlib
  --with-tcltk            use Tcl/Tk GUI (default is YES)
                          ARG is the full path to the Tcl/Tk interpreter.
                          Bare --with-tcltk will make the GUI part only if
                          Tcl/Tk interpreter will be found in a system.

Some influential environment variables:
  CC          C compiler command
  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
  CPP         C preprocessor

Use these variables to override the choices made by 'configure' or to help
it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.
