# Indicates that the build should be configured for debugging Rust. A

#
# Note: changes to the `debug` setting do *not* affect `optimize`

#       set `optimize` to `false` above to assist the introspection

#       `true`, because an unoptimized rustc with debugging
#       enabled becomes *unusably slow* (e.g. rust-lang/rust#24840
#       reported a 25x slowdown) and bootstrapping the supposed
#       "maximally debuggable" environment (notably libstd) takes
